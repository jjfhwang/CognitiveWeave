# CognitiveWeave: A Distributed Cognitive Processing Framework in Rust

CognitiveWeave is a Rust-based framework designed for building distributed cognitive processing applications. It provides a modular and extensible architecture for implementing complex algorithms involving data ingestion, processing, and decision-making across a network of computing nodes. The framework prioritizes performance, scalability, and fault tolerance, making it suitable for demanding applications in areas such as machine learning, data analytics, and artificial intelligence.

The core purpose of CognitiveWeave is to abstract away the complexities of distributed systems, allowing developers to focus on the implementation of cognitive algorithms rather than the underlying infrastructure. It achieves this through a combination of lightweight message passing, decentralized task scheduling, and robust error handling mechanisms. The framework enables the creation of applications that can seamlessly adapt to changing workloads and resource availability, ensuring consistent performance and reliability even in dynamic environments. By leveraging the safety and performance characteristics of Rust, CognitiveWeave provides a foundation for building secure and efficient distributed cognitive systems.

CognitiveWeave offers a range of features designed to simplify the development and deployment of distributed cognitive applications. These include a pluggable architecture that allows developers to easily integrate custom data sources, processing modules, and decision-making algorithms. It also incorporates built-in support for common data serialization formats, enabling seamless communication between nodes running different operating systems or architectures. Furthermore, CognitiveWeave provides a comprehensive set of monitoring and logging tools, allowing developers to track the performance of their applications and identify potential bottlenecks or errors. The framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing infrastructure and tools, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of cognitive processing tasks.

CognitiveWeave facilitates the development of applications capable of processing massive datasets and performing complex computations in parallel across multiple nodes. This distributed processing capability can significantly reduce the time required to analyze large datasets and make decisions, enabling real-time or near real-time cognitive processing. The frameworks fault tolerance mechanisms ensure that the application remains operational even in the event of node failures, preventing data loss and maintaining service availability. CognitiveWeaves modular design promotes code reusability and maintainability, reducing development time and costs while improving the overall quality of the software.

## Key Features

*   **Decentralized Task Scheduling:** CognitiveWeave utilizes a decentralized task scheduling algorithm based on a consistent hashing scheme. This ensures that tasks are distributed evenly across the available nodes, maximizing resource utilization and minimizing latency. Each node maintains a partial view of the network topology and is responsible for scheduling tasks assigned to its portion of the hash space.

*   **Asynchronous Message Passing:** Communication between nodes is handled using asynchronous message passing based on the Tokio runtime. This allows nodes to communicate without blocking, improving overall performance and responsiveness. Messages are serialized using Protocol Buffers for efficient and reliable data transmission.

*   **Pluggable Data Sources:** The framework supports pluggable data sources, allowing developers to easily integrate data from various sources, such as databases, message queues, and sensor networks. Data source plugins are implemented as Rust traits, providing a consistent interface for data ingestion.

*   **Customizable Processing Modules:** CognitiveWeave allows developers to define custom processing modules that can perform various cognitive tasks, such as data filtering, feature extraction, and machine learning. Processing modules are implemented as Rust functions or structs and can be easily chained together to create complex processing pipelines.

*   **Fault Tolerance:** The framework incorporates fault tolerance mechanisms, such as data replication and task rescheduling, to ensure that the application remains operational even in the event of node failures. When a node fails, its tasks are automatically rescheduled on other available nodes.

*   **Monitoring and Logging:** CognitiveWeave provides comprehensive monitoring and logging tools that allow developers to track the performance of their applications and identify potential bottlenecks or errors. Metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and network latency are collected and exposed through a REST API. Logs are generated using the log crate and can be configured to output to various destinations, such as files, the console, or a remote logging server.

*   **Dynamic Node Discovery:** CognitiveWeave uses a gossip protocol for dynamic node discovery. New nodes can automatically join the network, and existing nodes can detect and handle node failures. This ensures that the application can adapt to changes in the network topology without requiring manual intervention.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The core language used for developing the framework, leveraging its safety, performance, and concurrency features.
*   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for Rust, used for handling network communication and concurrent tasks.
*   **Protocol Buffers:** A language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data, used for efficient message passing.
*   **gRPC:** A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework, used for communication between components.
*   **Log:** Rust's logging facade, providing a consistent interface for logging messages from different parts of the framework.
*   **Consistent Hashing:** Used for distributing tasks evenly across the nodes in the cluster, ensuring scalability and load balancing.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can download them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2.  Clone the CognitiveWeave repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/CognitiveWeave.git
    cd CognitiveWeave

3.  Build the project:
    cargo build --release

4.  (Optional) Run the tests:
    cargo test

## Configuration

CognitiveWeave can be configured using environment variables. The following environment variables are supported:

*   `COGNITIVEWEAVE_NODE_ID`: A unique identifier for the node. (Required)
*   `COGNITIVEWEAVE_PORT`: The port on which the node will listen for incoming connections. (Default: 50051)
*   `COGNITIVEWEAVE_SEED_NODES`: A comma-separated list of seed nodes used for node discovery. (Optional)
*   `COGNITIVEWEAVE_LOG_LEVEL`: The log level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). (Default: `info`)

Example:

COGNITIVEWEAVE_NODE_ID=node1 COGNITIVEWEAVE_PORT=50052 COGNITIVEWEAVE_SEED_NODES=node0:50051 cargo run --release

## Usage

To start a CognitiveWeave node, run the following command:

./target/release/cognitiveweave

After starting the node, you can interact with it using the gRPC API. The API provides methods for submitting tasks, retrieving results, and monitoring the status of the node.

API Documentation (Example using `tonic` and a generated protobuf definition):

// Example of submitting a task using the gRPC client
use cognitiveweave_proto::cognitiveweave_client::CognitiveWeaveClient;
use cognitiveweave_proto::TaskRequest;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut client = CognitiveWeaveClient::connect("http://[::1]:50051").await?;

    let request = tonic::Request::new(TaskRequest {
        task_data: "Some task data".into(),
    });

    let response = client.submit_task(request).await?;

    println!("RESPONSE={:?}", response);

    Ok(())
}

(Note: This assumes the existence of `cognitiveweave_proto` which would be generated from your defined Protocol Buffers definition.)
