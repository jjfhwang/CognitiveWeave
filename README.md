# CognitiveWeave: Strengthening Generative AI Through Regularization and Adversarial Probing

CognitiveWeave is a Rust-based research project focused on enhancing the robustness and explainability of generative artificial intelligence architectures, specifically diffusion models. It achieves this through two primary mechanisms: diffusion tensor regularization, which promotes smoother and more coherent latent spaces during the diffusion process, and adversarial latent space probing, which identifies vulnerabilities and biases within the learned representations. The goal is to develop generative models that are not only powerful generators of novel content but also resistant to adversarial attacks and amenable to interpretability.

This repository provides the core algorithms and tools necessary to implement and experiment with these techniques. It offers a flexible framework for integrating diffusion tensor regularization into existing diffusion model training pipelines and provides sophisticated methods for probing the latent space using adversarial examples. By combining these approaches, CognitiveWeave aims to advance the state-of-the-art in robust and trustworthy generative AI, paving the way for safer and more reliable deployment in critical applications. Ultimately, this project seeks to address the growing concerns surrounding the susceptibility of generative models to adversarial manipulation and the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes.

CognitiveWeave empowers researchers and developers to build more resilient and understandable generative models. The library allows users to inject regularization during training to shape the latent space and defend against perturbations. Furthermore, the adversarial probing tools enable researchers to analyze the model's internal representations, uncovering potential biases and vulnerabilities. The integration of these techniques allows for a more thorough understanding of the generative process and facilitates the development of mitigation strategies for identified weaknesses. This framework can be applied to various diffusion model architectures and datasets, making it a versatile tool for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of generative AI.

## Key Features

*   **Diffusion Tensor Regularization:** Implements a novel regularization technique based on the diffusion tensor, penalizing excessive curvature in the latent space during the diffusion process. This encourages smoother transitions and improved coherence in generated samples. Specifically, the regularization term penalizes the Frobenius norm of the Hessian of the denoising score function with respect to the latent variable.

*   **Adversarial Latent Space Probing:** Provides a suite of tools for generating adversarial examples in the latent space, allowing for the identification of regions that are particularly vulnerable to manipulation. Utilizes gradient-based optimization techniques, such as projected gradient descent (PGD), to craft perturbations that maximize a defined loss function.

*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration with existing diffusion model implementations. The regularization and probing modules can be used independently or in combination, depending on the specific research goals.

*   **Rust-Based Performance:** Leveraging the performance and safety of Rust, CognitiveWeave offers efficient and reliable implementations of complex algorithms. This enables rapid experimentation and deployment of robust generative models. Parallelism is leveraged using Rayon to maximize CPU utilization during tensor computations.

*   **Extensible API:** Offers a flexible and extensible API for defining custom loss functions, regularization strategies, and adversarial attack configurations. This allows researchers to tailor the framework to their specific needs and explore novel approaches to robust generative modeling.

*   **Support for Multiple Diffusion Model Architectures:** Compatible with a range of diffusion model architectures, including DDPM, DDIM, and other variants. Provides example implementations for common architectures to facilitate easy integration.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The core programming language, providing performance, safety, and concurrency.
*   **ndarray:** Provides efficient n-dimensional array data structures and operations for numerical computation.
*   **rand:** Used for random number generation, essential for the diffusion process and adversarial attacks.
*   **rayon:** Facilitates parallel processing for computationally intensive tasks, such as tensor operations.
*   **serde:** For serialization and deserialization of data structures, enabling easy configuration and data handling.

## Installation

1.  **Install Rust:** If you don't have Rust installed, download and install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/CognitiveWeave.git
    cd CognitiveWeave

3.  **Build the project:**
    cargo build --release

4.  **Install required system dependencies:** This project may require system dependencies like BLAS or LAPACK for optimized linear algebra. Refer to your system's package manager for installation (e.g., `apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu).

## Configuration

CognitiveWeave uses environment variables for configuring various aspects of its behavior. These variables can be set in your shell environment or in a `.env` file in the project root directory.

*   `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: Specifies which GPUs to use (e.g., `0` for the first GPU, `0,1` for the first and second GPUs). Defaults to all available GPUs if not set.

*   `LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). Defaults to `info`.

*   `REGULARIZATION_LAMBDA`: The weight of the diffusion tensor regularization term. Higher values lead to stronger regularization. Defaults to `0.01`.

*   `ADVERSARIAL_EPSILON`: The maximum perturbation allowed during adversarial attack. Controls the strength of the attack. Defaults to `0.03`.

## Usage

Examples for using CognitiveWeave can be found in the `examples/` directory. A basic example of training a diffusion model with diffusion tensor regularization is shown below. This example assumes you have implemented a simple diffusion model and have data loading mechanisms in place. This code example should be considered pseudocode using Rust syntax.

// Example: Training with Diffusion Tensor Regularization

fn main() {
    let mut diffusion_model = DiffusionModel::new(); // Assume this is your diffusion model implementation
    let training_data = load_training_data();

    for epoch in 0..NUM_EPOCHS {
        for batch in training_data.iter() {
            let latent_space = diffusion_model.forward(batch); // Forward pass through the model

            let regularization_loss = compute_diffusion_tensor_regularization(latent_space);

            let total_loss = diffusion_model.compute_loss(batch, latent_space) + REGULARIZATION_LAMBDA * regularization_loss;

            diffusion_model.optimize(total_loss);
        }
    }
}

// Example: Adversarial Probing

fn main() {
    let mut diffusion_model = DiffusionModel::new(); // Assume this is your diffusion model implementation
    let input_image = load_image();

    let adversarial_image = generate_adversarial_example(input_image, &mut diffusion_model, ADVERSARIAL_EPSILON);

    let original_output = diffusion_model.generate(input_image);
    let adversarial_output = diffusion_model.generate(adversarial_image);

    println!("Original output: {:?}", original_output);
    println!("Adversarial output: {:?}", adversarial_output);
}
